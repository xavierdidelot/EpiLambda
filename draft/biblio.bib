These methods are compared with maximum likelihood on the basis of Asymptotic Relative Efficiency (ARE). For the beta binomial distribution a simple estimator based on moments or ratios of factorial moments has high ARE for most of the parameter space and it is an attractive and viable alternative to computing the maximum likelihood estimator. It is also simpler to compute than an estimator based on the mean and zeros, proposed by Chatfield and Goodhart (1970,Appl. Statist.,19, 240–250), and has much higher ARE for most part of the parameter space. For the truncated beta binomial, the simple estimator based on two moment relations does not behave quite as well as for the BB distribution, but a simple estimator based on two linear relations involving the first three moments and the frequency of “ones” has extremely high ARE. Some examples are provided to illustrate the procedure for the two models.},

  abstract =      {Population-level analyses often use average
                   quantities to describe heterogeneous systems,
                   particularly when variation does not arise from
                   identifiable groups. A prominent example, central to
                   our current understanding of epidemic spread, is the
                   basic reproductive number, R(0), which is defined as
                   the mean number of infections caused by an infected
                   individual in a susceptible population. Population
                   estimates of R(0) can obscure considerable individual
                   variation in infectiousness, as highlighted during
                   the global emergence of severe acute respiratory
                   syndrome (SARS) by numerous 'superspreading events'
                   in which certain individuals infected unusually large
                   numbers of secondary cases. For diseases transmitted
                   by non-sexual direct contacts, such as SARS or
                   smallpox, individual variation is difficult to
                   measure empirically, and thus its importance for
                   outbreak dynamics has been unclear. Here we present
                   an integrated theoretical and statistical analysis of
                   the influence of individual variation in
                   infectiousness on disease emergence. Using contact
                   tracing data from eight directly transmitted
                   diseases, we show that the distribution of individual
                   infectiousness around R(0) is often highly skewed.
                   Model predictions accounting for this variation
                   differ sharply from average-based approaches, with
                   disease extinction more likely and outbreaks rarer
                   but more explosive. Using these models, we explore
                   implications for outbreak control, showing that
                   individual-specific control measures outperform
                   population-wide measures. Moreover, the dramatic
                   improvements achieved through targeted control
                   policies emphasize the need to identify predictive
                   correlates of higher infectiousness. Our findings
                   indicate that superspreading is a normal feature of
                   disease spread, and to frame ongoing discussion we
                   propose a rigorous definition for superspreading
                   events and a method to predict their frequency.},

                   characteristic of coronavirus epidemiology is the
                   occurrence of superspreading events. These are marked
                   by a disproportionate number of cases originating
                   from often-times asymptomatic individuals. Using a
                   rich sequence dataset from the early stages of the

                   superspreading events in specific settings and

                   provides evidence that superspreading profoundly
                   influenced epidemic spread. , INTRODUCTION We used
                   genomic epidemiology to investigate the introduction
                   and spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome
                   coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the Boston area across
                   the first wave of the pandemic, from March through
                   May 2020, including high-density sampling early in
                   this period. Our analysis provides a window into the
                   amplification of transmission in an urban setting,
                   including the impact of superspreading events on
                   local, national, and international spread. RATIONALE
                   Superspreading is recognized as an important driver
                   of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but the determinants of
                   superspreading---why apparently similar circumstances
                   can lead to very different outcomes---are poorly
                   understood. The broader impact of such events, both
                   on local transmission and on the overall trajectory
                   of the pandemic, can also be difficult to determine.
                   Our dataset includes hundreds of cases that resulted
                   from superspreading events with different
                   epidemiological features, which allowed us to
                   investigate the nature and effect of superspreading
                   events in the first wave of the pandemic in the
                   Boston area and to track their broader impact.
                   RESULTS Our data suggest that there were more than
                   120 introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the Boston area,
                   but that only a few of these were responsible for
                   most local transmission: 29\% of the introductions
                   accounted for 85\% of the cases. At least some of
                   this variation results from superspreading events
                   amplifying some lineages and not others. Analysis of
                   two superspreading events in our dataset illustrate
                   how some introductions can be amplified by
                   superspreading. One occurred in a skilled nursing
                   facility, where multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2
                   were detected in a short time period. Only one of
                   these led to rapid and extensive spread within the
                   facility, and significant mortality in this
                   vulnerable population, but there was little onward
                   transmission. A second superspreading event, at an
                   international business conference, led to sustained
                   community transmission, including outbreaks in
                   homeless and other higher-risk communities, and was
                   exported domestically and internationally, ultimately
                   resulting in hundreds of thousands of cases. The two
                   events also differed substantially in the genetic
                   variation they generated, possibly suggesting varying
                   transmission dynamics in superspreading events. Our
                   results also show how genomic data can be used to
                   support cluster investigations in real time---in this
                   case, ruling out connections between contemporaneous
                   cases at Massachusetts General Hospital, where
                   nosocomial transmission was suspected. CONCLUSION Our
                   results provide powerful evidence of the importance
                   of superspreading events in shaping the course of
                   this pandemic and illustrate how some introductions,
                   when amplified under unfortunate circumstances, can
                   have an outsized effect with devastating consequences
                   that extend far beyond the initial events themselves.
                   Our findings further highlight the close
                   relationships between seemingly disconnected groups
                   and populations during a pandemic: Viruses introduced
                   at an international business conference seeded major
                   outbreaks among individuals experiencing
                   homelessness; spread throughout the Boston area,
                   including to other higher-risk communities; and were
                   exported extensively to other domestic and
                   international sites. They also illustrate an
                   important reality: Although superspreading among
                   vulnerable populations has a larger immediate impact
                   on mortality, the cost to society is greater for
                   superspreading events that involve younger,
                   healthier, and more mobile populations because of the
                   increased risk of subsequent transmission. This is
                   relevant to ongoing efforts to control the spread of
                   SARS-CoV-2, particularly if vaccines prove to be more
                   effective at preventing disease than blocking
                   transmission. Schematic outline of this genomic
                   epidemiology study. Illustrated are the numerous
                   introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the Boston area; the
                   minimal spread of most introductions; and the local,
                   national, and international impact of the
                   amplification of one introduction by a large
                   superspreading event. , Analysis of 772 complete
                   severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
                   (SARS-CoV-2) genomes from early in the Boston-area
                   epidemic revealed numerous introductions of the
                   virus, a small number of which led to most cases. The
                   data revealed two superspreading events. One, in a
                   skilled nursing facility, led to rapid transmission
                   and significant mortality in this vulnerable
                   population but little broader spread, whereas other
                   introductions into the facility had little effect.
                   The second, at an international business conference,
                   produced sustained community transmission and was
                   exported, resulting in extensive regional, national,
                   and international spread. The two events also
                   differed substantially in the genetic variation they
                   generated, suggesting varying transmission dynamics
                   in superspreading events. Our results show how
                   genomic epidemiology can help to understand the link
                   between individual clusters and wider community
                   spread.},

  abstract =      {A variety of methods based on coalescent theory have
                   been developed to infer demographic history from gene
                   sequences sampled from natural populations. The
                   `skyline plot' and related approaches are commonly
                   employed as flexible prior distributions for
                   phylogenetic trees in the Bayesian analysis of
                   pathogen gene sequences. In this work we extend the
                   classic and generalized skyline plot methods to
                   phylogenies that contain one or more multifurcations
                   (i.e. hard polytomies). We use the theory of
                   {$\Lambda$}-coalescents (specifically,
                   Beta(2-{$\alpha$},{$\alpha$})-coalescents) to develop
                   the `multifurcating skyline plot', which estimates a
                   piecewise constant function of effective population
                   size through time, conditional on a time-scaled
                   multifurcating phylogeny. We implement a smoothing
                   procedure and extend the method to serially sampled
                   (heterochronous) data, but we do not address here the
                   problem of estimating trees with multifurcations from
                   gene sequence alignments. We validate our estimator
                   on simulated data using maximum likelihood and find
                   that parameters of the Beta(2-{$\alpha$},{$\alpha$})
                   -coalescent process can be estimated accurately.
                   Furthermore, we apply the multifurcating skyline plot
                   to simulated trees generated by tracking
                   transmissions in an individual-based model of
                   epidemic superspreading. We find that high levels of
                   superspreading are consistent with the high-variance
                   assumptions underlying {$\Lambda$}-coalescents and
                   that the estimated parameters of the
                   {$\Lambda$}-coalescent model contain information
                   about the degree of superspreading.},

                   considered among the most important advances in
                   population genetics of the last decades. Demographic
                   inference based on coalescent theory has been used to
                   reconstruct the population dynamics and evolutionary
                   history of several species, including Mycobacterium
                   tuberculosis (MTB), an important human pathogen
                   causing tuberculosis. One key assumption of the
                   Kingman coalescent is that the number of descendants
                   of different individuals does not vary strongly, and
                   violating this assumption could lead to severe biases
                   caused by model misspecification. Individual lineages
                   of MTB are expected to vary strongly in reproductive
                   success because 1) MTB is potentially under constant
                   selection due to the pressure of the host immune
                   system and of antibiotic treatment, 2) MTB undergoes
                   repeated population bottlenecks when it transmits
                   from one host to the next, and 3) some hosts show
                   much higher transmission rates compared with the
                   average (superspreaders). Here, we used an
                   approximate Bayesian computation approach to test
                   whether multiple-merger coalescents (MMC), a class of
                   models that allow for large variation in reproductive
                   success among lineages, are more appropriate models
                   to study MTB populations. We considered 11 publicly
                   available whole-genome sequence data sets sampled
                   from local MTB populations and outbreaks and found
                   that MMC had a better fit compared with the Kingman
                   coalescent for 10 of the 11 data sets. These results
                   indicate that the null model for analyzing MTB
                   outbreaks should be reassessed and that past findings
                   based on the Kingman coalescent need to be
                   revisited.},

                   not consider the possibility of multiple merger
                   events being present, where a single node of the tree
                   leads to more than two descendent branches. These
                   events are however likely to occur when studying a
                   relatively small population or if there is high
                   variability in the reproductive chances. Here we
                   consider the problem of detecting the presence of
                   multiple mergers in the context of dating a
                   phylogeny, that is determining the date of each of
                   the nodes. We use the Lambda-coalescent theory as a
                   modelling framework and show how Bayesian inference
                   can be efficiently performed using a
                   Billera-Holmes-Vogtmann space embedding and a
                   customised Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling scheme.
                   We applied this new analysis methodology to a large
                   number of simulated datasets to show that it is
                   possible to infer if and when multiple merger events
                   occurred, and that the phylogenetic dating is
                   improved as a result of taking this information into
                   account. We also analysed real datasets of Vibrio
                   cholerae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis to
                   demonstrate the relevance of our approach to real
                   pathogen evolutionary epidemiology.We have
