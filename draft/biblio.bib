                   properties of emerging infectious agents that
                   determine the likely success of two simple public
                   health measures in controlling outbreaks, namely ( i
                   ) isolating symptomatic individuals and ( ii )
                   tracing and quarantining their contacts. Because
                   these measures depend on the recognition of specific
                   disease symptoms, we investigate the relative timing
                   of infectiousness and the appearance of symptoms by
                   using a mathematical model. We show that the success
                   of these control measures is determined as much by
                   the proportion of transmission occurring prior to the
                   onset of overt clinical symptoms (or via asymptomatic
                   infection) as the inherent transmissibility of the
                   etiological agent (measured by the reproductive
                   number R 0 ). From published studies, we estimate
                   these quantities for two moderately transmissible
                   viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome
                   coronavirus and HIV, and for two highly transmissible
                   viruses, smallpox and pandemic influenza. We conclude
                   that severe acute respiratory syndrome and smallpox
                   are easier to control using these simple public
                   health measures. Direct estimation of the proportion
                   of asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections is
                   achievable by contact tracing and should be a
                   priority during an outbreak of a novel infectious
                   agent.},

                   quantities to describe heterogeneous systems,
                   particularly when variation does not arise from
                   identifiable groups. A prominent example, central to
                   our current understanding of epidemic spread, is the
                   basic reproductive number, R(0), which is defined as
                   the mean number of infections caused by an infected
                   individual in a susceptible population. Population
                   estimates of R(0) can obscure considerable individual
                   variation in infectiousness, as highlighted during
                   the global emergence of severe acute respiratory
                   syndrome (SARS) by numerous 'superspreading events'
                   in which certain individuals infected unusually large
                   numbers of secondary cases. For diseases transmitted
                   by non-sexual direct contacts, such as SARS or
                   smallpox, individual variation is difficult to
                   measure empirically, and thus its importance for
                   outbreak dynamics has been unclear. Here we present
                   an integrated theoretical and statistical analysis of
                   the influence of individual variation in
                   infectiousness on disease emergence. Using contact
                   tracing data from eight directly transmitted
                   diseases, we show that the distribution of individual
                   infectiousness around R(0) is often highly skewed.
                   Model predictions accounting for this variation
                   differ sharply from average-based approaches, with
                   disease extinction more likely and outbreaks rarer
                   but more explosive. Using these models, we explore
                   implications for outbreak control, showing that
                   individual-specific control measures outperform
                   population-wide measures. Moreover, the dramatic
                   improvements achieved through targeted control
                   policies emphasize the need to identify predictive
                   correlates of higher infectiousness. Our findings
                   indicate that superspreading is a normal feature of
                   disease spread, and to frame ongoing discussion we
                   propose a rigorous definition for superspreading
                   events and a method to predict their frequency.},

                   interactions assumed that infected individuals within
                   a population have equal chances of transmitting the
                   infection to others. Subsequently, in what became
                   known as the 20/80 rule, a small percentage of
                   individuals within any population was observed to
                   control most transmission events. This empirical rule
                   was shown to govern inter-individual transmission
                   dynamics for many pathogens in several species, and
                   individuals who infect disproportionately more
                   secondary contacts, as compared to most others,
                   became known as superspreaders. Studies conducted in
                   the wake of the severe acute respiratory syndrome
                   (SARS) pandemic revealed that, in the absence of
                   super-spreading events, most individuals infect few,
                   if any, secondary contacts. The analysis of SARS

                   unveil a complex scenario in which super-spreading
                   events are shaped by multiple factors, including
                   co-infection with another pathogen, immune
                   suppression, changes in airflow dynamics, delayed

                   transfers. Predicting and identifying super-spreaders

                   Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and
                   coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have caused
                   substantial public health burdens and global health
                   threats. Understanding the superspreading potentials
                   of these viruses are important for characterizing
                   transmission patterns and informing strategic
                   decision-making in disease control. This systematic
                   review aimed to summarize the existing evidence on
                   superspreading features and to compare the
                   heterogeneity in transmission within and among
                   various betacoronavirus epidemics of SARS, MERS and
                   COVID-19. Methods: PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase
                   databases were extensively searched for original
                   studies on the transmission heterogeneity of SARS,
                   MERS, and COVID-19 published in English between
                   January 1, 2003, and February 10, 2021. After
                   screening the articles, we extracted data pertaining
                   to the estimated dispersion parameter (k) which has
                   been a commonly-used measurement for superspreading
                   potential. Findings: We included a total of 60
                   estimates of transmission heterogeneity from 26
                   studies on outbreaks in 22 regions. The majority
                   (90\%) of the k estimates were small, with values
                   less than 1, indicating an over-dispersed
                   transmission pattern. The point estimates of k for
                   SARS and MERS ranged from 0.12 to 0.20 and from 0.06
                   to 2.94, respectively. Among 45 estimates of
                   individual-level transmission heterogeneity for
                   COVID-19 from 17 articles, 91\% were derived from
                   Asian regions. The point estimates of k for COVID-19
                   ranged between 0.1 and 5.0. Conclusions: We detected
                   a substantial over-dispersed transmission pattern in
                   all three coronaviruses, while the k estimates varied
                   by differences in study design and public health
                   capacity. Our findings suggested that even with a
                   reduced R value, the epidemic still has a high
                   resurgence potential due to transmission
                   heterogeneity.},

  abstract =      {Phylogenetics of superspreading One important
                   characteristic of coronavirus epidemiology is the
                   occurrence of superspreading events. These are marked
                   by a disproportionate number of cases originating
                   from often-times asymptomatic individuals. Using a
                   rich sequence dataset from the early stages of the
                   Boston outbreak, Lemieux et al. identified
                   superspreading events in specific settings and
                   analyzed them phylogenetically (see the Perspective
                   by Alizon). Using ancestral trait inference, the
                   authors identified several importation events,
                   further investigated the context and contribution of
                   particular superspreading events to the establishment
                   of local and wider SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and used
                   viral phylogenies to describe sustained transmission.

                   Phylogenetic analysis of complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes
                   provides evidence that superspreading profoundly
                   influenced epidemic spread. , INTRODUCTION We used
                   genomic epidemiology to investigate the introduction
                   and spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome
                   coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the Boston area across
                   the first wave of the pandemic, from March through
                   May 2020, including high-density sampling early in
                   this period. Our analysis provides a window into the
                   amplification of transmission in an urban setting,
                   including the impact of superspreading events on
                   local, national, and international spread. RATIONALE
                   Superspreading is recognized as an important driver
                   of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but the determinants of
                   superspreading---why apparently similar circumstances
                   can lead to very different outcomes---are poorly
                   understood. The broader impact of such events, both
                   on local transmission and on the overall trajectory
                   of the pandemic, can also be difficult to determine.
                   Our dataset includes hundreds of cases that resulted
                   from superspreading events with different
                   epidemiological features, which allowed us to
                   investigate the nature and effect of superspreading
                   events in the first wave of the pandemic in the
                   Boston area and to track their broader impact.
                   RESULTS Our data suggest that there were more than
                   120 introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the Boston area,
                   but that only a few of these were responsible for
                   most local transmission: 29\% of the introductions
                   accounted for 85\% of the cases. At least some of
                   this variation results from superspreading events
                   amplifying some lineages and not others. Analysis of
                   two superspreading events in our dataset illustrate
                   how some introductions can be amplified by
                   superspreading. One occurred in a skilled nursing
                   facility, where multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2
                   were detected in a short time period. Only one of
                   these led to rapid and extensive spread within the
                   facility, and significant mortality in this
                   vulnerable population, but there was little onward
                   transmission. A second superspreading event, at an
                   international business conference, led to sustained
                   community transmission, including outbreaks in
                   homeless and other higher-risk communities, and was
                   exported domestically and internationally, ultimately
                   resulting in hundreds of thousands of cases. The two
                   events also differed substantially in the genetic
                   variation they generated, possibly suggesting varying
                   transmission dynamics in superspreading events. Our
                   results also show how genomic data can be used to
                   support cluster investigations in real time---in this
                   case, ruling out connections between contemporaneous
                   cases at Massachusetts General Hospital, where
                   nosocomial transmission was suspected. CONCLUSION Our
                   results provide powerful evidence of the importance
                   of superspreading events in shaping the course of
                   this pandemic and illustrate how some introductions,
                   when amplified under unfortunate circumstances, can
                   have an outsized effect with devastating consequences
                   that extend far beyond the initial events themselves.
                   Our findings further highlight the close
                   relationships between seemingly disconnected groups
                   and populations during a pandemic: Viruses introduced
                   at an international business conference seeded major
                   outbreaks among individuals experiencing
                   homelessness; spread throughout the Boston area,
                   including to other higher-risk communities; and were
                   exported extensively to other domestic and
                   international sites. They also illustrate an
                   important reality: Although superspreading among
                   vulnerable populations has a larger immediate impact
                   on mortality, the cost to society is greater for
                   superspreading events that involve younger,
                   healthier, and more mobile populations because of the
                   increased risk of subsequent transmission. This is
                   relevant to ongoing efforts to control the spread of
                   SARS-CoV-2, particularly if vaccines prove to be more
                   effective at preventing disease than blocking
                   transmission. Schematic outline of this genomic
                   epidemiology study. Illustrated are the numerous
                   introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the Boston area; the
                   minimal spread of most introductions; and the local,
                   national, and international impact of the
                   amplification of one introduction by a large
                   superspreading event. , Analysis of 772 complete
                   severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
                   (SARS-CoV-2) genomes from early in the Boston-area
                   epidemic revealed numerous introductions of the
                   virus, a small number of which led to most cases. The
                   data revealed two superspreading events. One, in a
                   skilled nursing facility, led to rapid transmission
                   and significant mortality in this vulnerable
                   population but little broader spread, whereas other
                   introductions into the facility had little effect.
                   The second, at an international business conference,
                   produced sustained community transmission and was
                   exported, resulting in extensive regional, national,
                   and international spread. The two events also
                   differed substantially in the genetic variation they
                   generated, suggesting varying transmission dynamics
                   in superspreading events. Our results show how
                   genomic epidemiology can help to understand the link
                   between individual clusters and wider community
                   spread.},

                   a feature of SARS-CoV-2 transmission which results in
                   surging epidemics and large clusters of infection.
                   The dispersion parameter is a statistical parameter
                   used to characterize and quantify heterogeneity. In
                   the context of measuring transmissibility, it is
                   analogous to measures of superspreading potential
                   among populations by assuming that collective
                   offspring distribution follows a negative-binomial
                   distribution. We conducted a systematic review and
                   meta-analysis on globally reported dispersion
                   parameters of SARS-CoV-2 infection. All searches were
                   carried out on 10 September 2021 in PubMed for
                   articles published from 1 January 2020 to 10
                   September 2021. Multiple estimates of the dispersion
                   parameter have been published for 17 studies, which
                   could be related to where and when the data were
                   obtained, in 8 countries (e.g. China, the United
                   States, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, New Zealand
                   and Singapore). High heterogeneity was reported among
                   the included studies. The mean estimates of
                   dispersion parameters range from 0.06 to 2.97 over
                   eight countries, the pooled estimate was 0.55 (95\%
                   CI: 0.30, 0.79), with changing means over countries
                   and decreasing slightly with the increasing
                   reproduction number. The expected proportion of cases
                   accounting for 80\% of all transmissions is 19\%
                   (95\% CrI: 7, 34) globally. The study location and
                   method were found to be important drivers for
                   diversity in estimates of dispersion parameters.
                   While under high potential of superspreading, larger
                   outbreaks could still occur with the import of the
                   COVID-19 virus by traveling even when an epidemic

                   N(e) can be poorly correlated with the true
                   population size. The relationship between N(e) and
                   the population size is sensitive to the way in which
                   birth and death rates vary over time. The problem of
                   inference is exacerbated when the mechanisms
                   underlying population dynamics are complex and depend
                   on many parameters. In instances where nonparametric
                   estimators of N(e) such as the skyline struggle to
                   reproduce the correct demographic history,
                   model-based estimators that can draw on prior
                   information about population size and growth rates
                   may be more efficient. A coalescent model is
                   developed for a large class of populations such that
                   the demographic history is described by a
                   deterministic nonlinear dynamical system of arbitrary
                   dimension. This class of demographic model differs
                   from those typically used in population genetics.
                   Birth and death rates are not fixed, and no
                   assumptions are made regarding the fraction of the
                   population sampled. Furthermore, the population may
                   be structured in such a way that gene copies
                   reproduce both within and across demes. For this
                   large class of models, it is shown how to derive the
                   rate of coalescence, as well as the likelihood of a
                   gene genealogy with heterochronous sampling and
                   labeled taxa, and how to simulate a coalescent tree
                   conditional on a complex demographic history. This
                   theoretical framework encapsulates many of the models
                   used by ecologists and epidemiologists and should
                   facilitate the integration of population genetics

                   data, disease ecologists now regularly apply this
                   body of theory to viral phylogenies, most commonly in

                   of coalescent theory have not been explicitly linked

                   rate of coalescence under the assumption that the
                   disease dynamics are at their endemic equilibrium. We
                   apply this approach to four common families of
                   epidemiological models: standard
  susceptible-infected-susceptible/susceptible-infected-recovered/susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible
  models, models with individual heterogeneity in infectivity, models with an
  exposed but not yet infectious class and models with variable distributions
  of the infectious period. These results improve our understanding of how
  epidemiological processes shape viral genealogies, as well as how these
  processes affect levels of viral diversity and rates of genetic drift.
  Finally, we discuss how a subset of these coalescent rate expressions can be
  used for phylodynamic inference in non-equilibrium settings. For the ones
  that are limited to equilibrium conditions, we also discuss why this is the
  case. These results, therefore, point towards necessary future work while
  providing intuition on how epidemiological characteristics of the infection
  process impact gene genealogies.},

                   disease. The offspring distribution affects the
                   relationship between population dynamics and the
                   genealogy, and for infectious diseases, the offspring
                   distribution 15 is often highly overdispersed. Here,
                   we provide a general formula for the coalescent rate
                   for populations with time-varying sizes and any

                   differences in the coalescent rate derived for many

                   compared with maximum likelihood on the basis of

  abstract =      {A variety of methods based on coalescent theory have
                   been developed to infer demographic history from gene
                   sequences sampled from natural populations. The
                   `skyline plot' and related approaches are commonly
                   employed as flexible prior distributions for
                   phylogenetic trees in the Bayesian analysis of
                   pathogen gene sequences. In this work we extend the
                   classic and generalized skyline plot methods to
                   phylogenies that contain one or more multifurcations
                   (i.e. hard polytomies). We use the theory of
                   {$\Lambda$}-coalescents (specifically,
                   Beta(2-{$\alpha$},{$\alpha$})-coalescents) to develop
                   the `multifurcating skyline plot', which estimates a
                   piecewise constant function of effective population
                   size through time, conditional on a time-scaled
                   multifurcating phylogeny. We implement a smoothing
                   procedure and extend the method to serially sampled
                   (heterochronous) data, but we do not address here the
                   problem of estimating trees with multifurcations from
                   gene sequence alignments. We validate our estimator
                   on simulated data using maximum likelihood and find
                   that parameters of the Beta(2-{$\alpha$},{$\alpha$})
                   -coalescent process can be estimated accurately.
                   Furthermore, we apply the multifurcating skyline plot
                   to simulated trees generated by tracking
                   transmissions in an individual-based model of
                   epidemic superspreading. We find that high levels of
                   superspreading are consistent with the high-variance
                   assumptions underlying {$\Lambda$}-coalescents and
                   that the estimated parameters of the
                   {$\Lambda$}-coalescent model contain information
                   about the degree of superspreading.},

                   considered among the most important advances in
                   population genetics of the last decades. Demographic
                   inference based on coalescent theory has been used to
                   reconstruct the population dynamics and evolutionary
                   history of several species, including Mycobacterium
                   tuberculosis (MTB), an important human pathogen
                   causing tuberculosis. One key assumption of the
                   Kingman coalescent is that the number of descendants
                   of different individuals does not vary strongly, and
                   violating this assumption could lead to severe biases
                   caused by model misspecification. Individual lineages
                   of MTB are expected to vary strongly in reproductive
                   success because 1) MTB is potentially under constant
                   selection due to the pressure of the host immune
                   system and of antibiotic treatment, 2) MTB undergoes
                   repeated population bottlenecks when it transmits
                   from one host to the next, and 3) some hosts show
                   much higher transmission rates compared with the
                   average (superspreaders). Here, we used an
                   approximate Bayesian computation approach to test
                   whether multiple-merger coalescents (MMC), a class of
                   models that allow for large variation in reproductive
                   success among lineages, are more appropriate models
                   to study MTB populations. We considered 11 publicly
                   available whole-genome sequence data sets sampled
                   from local MTB populations and outbreaks and found
                   that MMC had a better fit compared with the Kingman
                   coalescent for 10 of the 11 data sets. These results
                   indicate that the null model for analyzing MTB
                   outbreaks should be reassessed and that past findings
                   based on the Kingman coalescent need to be
                   revisited.},

                   not consider the possibility of multiple merger
                   events being present, where a single node of the tree
                   leads to more than two descendent branches. These
                   events are however likely to occur when studying a
                   relatively small population or if there is high
                   variability in the reproductive chances. Here we
                   consider the problem of detecting the presence of
                   multiple mergers in the context of dating a
                   phylogeny, that is determining the date of each of
                   the nodes. We use the Lambda-coalescent theory as a
                   modelling framework and show how Bayesian inference
                   can be efficiently performed using a
                   Billera-Holmes-Vogtmann space embedding and a
                   customised Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling scheme.
                   We applied this new analysis methodology to a large
                   number of simulated datasets to show that it is
                   possible to infer if and when multiple merger events
                   occurred, and that the phylogenetic dating is
                   improved as a result of taking this information into
                   account. We also analysed real datasets of Vibrio
                   cholerae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis to
                   demonstrate the relevance of our approach to real

                   renders them amenable to Monte Carlo estimation. We

  abstract =      {Multiple-merger coalescents, also known as
                   {$\Lambda$}-coalescents, have been used to describe
                   the genealogy of populations that have a skewed
                   offspring distribution or that undergo strong
                   selection. Inferring the characteristic measure
                   {$\Lambda$}, which describes the rates of the
                   multiple-merger events, is key to understand these
                   processes. So far, most inference methods only work
                   for some particular families of
                   {$\Lambda$}-coalescents that are described by only
                   one parameter, but not for more general models. This
                   article is devoted to the construction of a
                   non-parametric estimator of the density of
                   {$\Lambda$} that is based on the observation at a
                   single time of the so-called Site Frequency Spectrum
                   (SFS), which describes the allelic frequencies in a
                   present population sample. First, we produce
                   estimates of the multiple-merger rates by solving a
                   linear system, whose coefficients are obtained by
                   appropriately subsampling the SFS. Then, we use a
                   technique that aggregates the information extracted
                   from the previous step through a kernel type of
                   re-construction to give a non-parametric estimation
                   of the measure {$\Lambda$}. We give a consistency
                   result of this estimator under mild conditions on the
                   behavior of {$\Lambda$} around 0. We also show some
                   numerical examples of how our method performs.},

                   increasingly rely on the analysis of genetic sequence
                   data. In particular, genetic data coupled with dates
                   and locations of sampled isolates can be used to
                   reconstruct the spatiotemporal dynamics of pathogens
                   during outbreaks. Thus far, phylogenetic methods have
                   been used to tackle this issue. Although these
                   approaches have proved useful for informing on the
                   spread of pathogens, they do not aim at directly
                   reconstructing the underlying transmission tree.
                   Instead, phylogenetic models infer most recent common
                   ancestors between pairs of isolates, which can be
                   inadequate for densely sampled recent outbreaks,
                   where the sample includes ancestral and descendent
                   isolates. In this paper, we introduce a novel method
                   based on a graph approach to reconstruct transmission
                   trees directly from genetic data. Using simulated
                   data, we show that our approach can efficiently
                   reconstruct genealogies of isolates in situations
                   where classical phylogenetic approaches fail to do
                   so. We then illustrate our method by analyzing data
                   from the early stages of the swine-origin A/H1N1
                   influenza pandemic. Using 433 isolates sequenced at
                   both the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes, we
                   reconstruct the likely history of the worldwide
                   spread of this new influenza strain. The presented
                   methodology opens new perspectives for the analysis
                   of genetic data in the context of disease outbreaks.},

                   disease outbreaks, but an important question remains
                   unanswered -- how well do genomic data capture known
                   transmission events, particularly for pathogens with
                   long carriage periods or large within-host population
                   sizes? Here we present a novel Bayesian approach to
                   reconstruct densely-sampled outbreaks from genomic
                   data whilst considering within-host diversity. We
                   infer a time-labelled phylogeny using BEAST, then
                   infer a transmission network via a Monte-Carlo Markov
                   Chain. We find that under a realistic model of
                   within-host evolution, reconstructions of simulated
                   outbreaks contain substantial uncertainty even when
                   genomic data reflect a high substitution rate.
                   Reconstruction of a real-world tuberculosis outbreak
                   displayed similar uncertainty, although the correct
                   source case and several clusters of epidemiologically
                   linked cases were identified. We conclude that
                   genomics cannot wholly replace traditional
                   epidemiology, but that Bayesian reconstructions
                   derived from sequence data may form a useful starting
                   point for a genomic epidemiology investigation.},

                   infectious disease epidemiology. Isolates from a
                   given outbreak are sequenced, and the patterns of
                   shared variation are used to infer which isolates
                   within the outbreak are most closely related to each
                   other. Unfortunately, the phylogenetic trees
                   typically used to represent this variation are not
                   directly informative about who infected whom -- a
                   phylogenetic tree is not a transmission tree.
                   However, a transmission tree can be inferred from a
                   phylogeny while accounting for within-host genetic
                   diversity by colouring the branches of a phylogeny
                   according to which host those branches were in. Here
                   we extend this approach and show that it can be
                   applied to partially sampled and ongoing outbreaks.
                   This requires computing the correct probability of an
                   observed transmission tree and we herein demonstrate
                   how to do this for a large class of epidemiological
                   models. We also demonstrate how the branch colouring
                   approach can incorporate a variable number of unique
                   colours to represent unsampled intermediates in
                   transmission chains. The resulting algorithm is a
                   reversible jump Monte-Carlo Markov Chain, which we
                   apply to both simulated data and real data from an
                   outbreak of tuberculosis. By accounting for unsampled
                   cases and an outbreak which may not have reached its
                   end, our method is uniquely suited to use in a public
                   health environment during real-time outbreak
                   investigations. We implemented our technique in an R

  abstract =      {We present an analysis of the first 10 weeks of the
                   severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in
                   Hong Kong. The epidemic to date has been
                   characterized by two large clusters-initiated by two
                   separate "super-spread" events (SSEs)-and by ongoing
                   community transmission. By fitting a stochastic model
                   to data on 1512 cases, including these clusters, we
                   show that the etiological agent of SARS is moderately
                   transmissible. Excluding SSEs, we estimate that 2.7
                   secondary infections were generated per case on
                   average at the start of the epidemic, with a
                   substantial contribution from hospital transmission.
                   Transmission rates fell during the epidemic,
                   primarily as a result of reductions in population
                   contact rates and improved hospital infection
                   control, but also because of more rapid hospital
                   attendance by symptomatic individuals. As a result,
                   the epidemic is now in decline, although continued
                   vigilance is necessary for this to be maintained.
                   Restrictions on longer range population movement are
                   shown to be a potentially useful additional control
                   measure in some contexts. We estimate that most
                   currently infected persons are now hospitalized,
                   which highlights the importance of control of
                   nosocomial transmission.},

                   is commonly used to monitor the transmissibility of
                   an infectious disease during an epidemic, but
                   standard methods for estimating Rt seldom account for
                   the impact of overdispersion on transmission.
                   Methods: We developed a negative binomial framework
                   to estimate Rt and a time-varying dispersion
                   parameter (kt). We applied the framework to COVID-19
                   incidence data in Hong Kong in 2020 and 2021. We
                   conducted a simulation study to compare the
                   performance of our model with the conventional
                   Poisson-based approach. Results: Our framework
                   estimated an Rt peaking around 4 (95\% credible
                   interval = 3.13, 4.30), similar to that from the
                   Poisson approach but with a better model fit. Our
                   approach further estimated kt {$<$}0.5 at the start
                   of both waves, indicating appreciable heterogeneity
                   in transmission. We also found that kt decreased
                   sharply to around 0.4 when a large cluster of
                   infections occurred. Conclusions: Our proposed
                   approach can contribute to the estimation of Rt and
                   monitoring of the time-varying dispersion parameters
                   to quantify the role of superspreading.},

  abstract = {After more than fifteen years of existence, the R package ape has continuously grown its contents, and has been used by a growing community of users. The release of version 5.0 has marked a leap towards a modern software for evolutionary analyses. Efforts have been put to improve efficiency, flexibility, support for 'big data' (R's long vectors), ease of use and quality check before a new release. These changes will hopefully make ape a useful software for the study of biodiversity and evolution in a context of increasing data quantity. Availability and implementation: ape is distributed through the Comprehensive R Archive Network: http://cran.r-project.org/package{$\frac{1}{4}$}ape. Further information may be found at Since its first release in August 2002, the R (R Core Team, 2017) package ape (Paradis et al., 2004) has developed steadily to provide a set of tools for researchers in evolutionary biology who seek to integrate analyses of DNA sequences, phenotypes and phylogenetic trees. With the release of its version 5.0, ape has marked a leap towards a modern software for evolutionary analyses. In the perspective of this release, efforts were put in improving the existing functionalities, providing easy-to-use functions for some basic tasks (e.g. finding data files), and improving the quality checks with respect to the published packages that depend on ape. There is evidence of a substantial number of users of ape coming from two sources. First, the number of downloads of ape during a few days after a new release has been observed to be around 22 000 (data from https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/). Second, ape has been cited in more than 600 journals from all fields of life and environmental sciences , and some titles in human sciences (data from Web of Science) suggesting it is widely used in the scientific community. With its version 5.0, ape supports all types of phylogenetic trees and networks. The function read.tree, already present in the first release of ape, can read trees with nodes of degree two (which was not possible before), and the new function read.evonet can read phylogenetic networks from extended Newick format files (Cardona et al., 2008). In addition, the R code to read Newick and NEXUS files (which have served during almost fifteen years) has been replaced by a more efficient C code. ape has its own data object class to store and manipulate DNA sequences (called 'DNAbin'). In the recent versions, we have implemented R 'long vectors' for the 'DNAbin' class so that sequences longer than 2.1 Gb (gigabases) can be read and analysed. The new limit for a sequence length is \%4.4 Pb ({$\frac{1}{4}$} 4:4 {\^A} 10 15 bases) which is more than one thousand larger than the currently available data from GenBank and the Genome Projects combined (estimated to be between 2 and 3 Tb). Furthermore, ape is able, in theory, to manipulate \% 4:4 {\^A} 10 15 sequences each of 4.4 Pb which amounts to a total of \% 2 {\^A} 10 31 bases. Clearly, this quantity is much larger than the quantity of active memory of all machines available in the world combined. In addition to these technical improvements, functions to convert the data classes used in BioConductor (Huber et al., 2015) are now provided. To further integrate phylogenetics with the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data, there is also a new function to read FASTQ files (read.fastq) to help screen DNA reads and their qualities. Reading data from files is a common bottleneck in data analysis which becomes crucial in the context of modern genomic data.},

Traditionally, Bayesian modeling coupled with the standard coalescent, is used to infer the sample's bifurcating genealogy and demographic and evolutionary parameters such as effective population size, and mutation rates. However, there are many situations where binary coalescent models do not accurately reflect the true underlying ancestral processes. Here, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric method for inferring effective population size trajectories from a multifurcating genealogy under the {$\Lambda-$}coalescent. In particular, we jointly estimate the effective population size and model parameters for the Beta-coalescent model, a special type of {$\Lambda-$}coalescent. Finally, we test our methods on simulations and apply them to study various viral dynamics as well as Japanese sardine population size changes over time. The code and vignettes can be found in the phylodyn package.},

For example, knowledge of a population's history can allow us to test hypotheses about the impact of climatic and anthropogenic factors. In the past, demographic analysis was typically limited to relatively simple population models, such as exponential or logistic growth. More flexible approaches are now available, including skyline-plot methods that are able to reconstruct changes in population sizes through time. This technical review focuses on these skyline-plot methods. We describe some general principles relating to sampling design and data collection. We then provide an outline of the methodological framework, which is based on coalescent theory, before tracing the development of the various skyline-plot methods and describing their key features. The performance and properties of the methods are illustrated using two simulated data sets.},

The simulations reveal that (i) the performance of exponential growth model estimates is determined by a simple function of the true parameter values and (ii) under some conditions, estimates from reconstructed trees perform as well as estimates from perfect trees. We apply our methods to HIV-1 sequence data and find strong evidence that subtypes A and B have different demographic histories.

As a result, when we sample n individuals from a population and trace their ancestral lines backwards in time, many lineages may coalesce almost instantaneously at the time of a selective sweep. We show that as the population size goes to infinity, this process converges to a coalescent process called a coalescent with multiple collisions. A better approximation for finite populations can be obtained using a coalescent with simultaneous multiple collisions. We also show how these coalescent approximations can be used to get insight into how beneficial mutations affect the behavior of statistics that have been used to detect departures from the usual Kingman's coalescent. {\copyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

These follow from a consideration of patterns of genetic diversity in a sample of DNA sequences. Five different possible limit processes, each with a different scaled mutation parameter, can be used to describe genetic diversity in a large population. Only one of these corresponds to the usual population genetic model, and the others make drastically different predictions about genetic diversity. The complexity arises because individuals can potentially have very many offspring. To the extent that this occurs in a given species, our results imply that inferences from genetic data made under the usual assumptions are likely to be wrong. Our results also uncover a fundamental difference between populations in which generations are overlapping and those in which generations are discrete. We choose one of the five limit processes that appears to be appropriate for some marine organisms and use a sample of genetic data from a population of Pacific oysters to infer the parameters of the model. The data suggest the presence of rare reproduction events in which  8\% of the population is replaced by the offspring of a single individual.},

Our analysis demonstrated that all but one of the hyperinvasive isolates established by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and MLST were grouped into one of six genealogical lineages, each of which contained substantial variation. Due to the confounding effect of recombination, evolutionary relationships among these lineages remained unclear, even using 20 loci. Analyses of the seven loci in the standard MLST scheme using the same methods reproduced this classification, but were unable to support finer inferences concerning the relationships between the members within each complex.},

Including all relevant data into a single joint model is very challenging both conceptually and computationally. Advanced computational software packages that allow robust development of compatible (sub-)models which can be composed into a full model hierarchy have played a key role in these developments. Developing such software frameworks is increasingly a major scientific activity in its own right, and comes with specific challenges, from practical software design, development and engineering challenges to statistical and conceptual modelling challenges. BEAST 2 is one such computational software platform, and was first announced over 4 years ago.

The tool of choice for such a study is often to build a phylogenetic tree, and more specifically when possible a dated phylogeny, in which the dates of all common ancestors are estimated. Here we propose a new Bayesian methodology to construct dated phylogenies which is specifically designed for bacterial genomics. Unlike previous Bayesian methods aimed at building dated phylogenies, we consider that the phylogenetic relationships between the genomes have been previously evaluated using a standard phylogenetic method, which makes our methodology much faster and scalable. This two-steps approach also allows us to directly exploit existing phylogenetic methods that detect bacterial recombination, and therefore to account for the effect of recombination in the construction of a dated phylogeny. We analysed many simulated datasets in order to benchmark the performance of our approach in a wide range of situations. Furthermore, we present applications to three different real datasets from recent bacterial genomic studies. Our methodology is implemented in a R package called BactDating which is freely available for download at https://github.com/xavierdidelot/BactDating.},

  abstract = {Coalescent theory is the study of random processes where particles may join each other to form clusters as time evolves. These notes provide an introduction to some aspects of the mathematics of coalescent processes and their applications to theoretical population genetics and other fields such as spin glass models. The emphasis is on recent work concerning in particular the connection of these processes to continuum random trees and spatial models such as coalescing random walks.},
